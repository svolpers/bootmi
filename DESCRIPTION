Description: The package is an implementation of bootstrapping imputed 
    (survey) data as proposed by Shao and Sitter (1996) in R. In addition, the
    method makes optional use of residual centering as proposed by Little,
    Bovaird and Widaman (2006), MICE as provided by van Buuren and
    Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011), and takes into account the "transform, then 
    impute" procedure as proposed by von Hippel (2009). For faster 
    computation, the parallel-package is implemented.
