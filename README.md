BOOTMI: Bootstrap imputed (survey) data
=======================================

The `bootmi` package implements a method boostrap imputed survey data, based on the proposed procedure of Shao and Sitter (1996).

Installation
------------

At the moment, the `bootmi` package can NOT be installed from CRAN. I am working on this.

The latest version is can be installed from GitHub as follows:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github(repo = "svolpers/bootmi")
```
