#' @title bootmi: Bootstrap multiple imputed (survey) data and analyze it
#' @description
#' The bootmi package is basically about bootstrapping imputed (survey) data 
#' as proposed by Shao and Sitter (1996). Furthermore, residual centering as 
#' proposed by Little, Bovaird and Widaman (2006), MICE as provided by 
#' van Buuren and Groothuis-Oudshoorn (2011), and the "transform, then impute 
#' procedure" as proposed by von Hippel (2009) are implemented. In addition to 
#' analysing bootstrapped imputed (survey) data, analysis of the simple slopes 
#' as proposed by Aiken and West (1991) and regions of significance as 
#' proposed by are also implemented for linear models (lm), multilevel models 
#' (lmer) and mice models (mice).
